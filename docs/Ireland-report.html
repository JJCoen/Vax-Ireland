<p>The analysis presented here incorporates the latest mortality counts from the CSO.  Another reason for this complimentary report is reproducibility.  On this website, the researcher can identify the source data files used, access code for transforming that data and for performing exploratory analysis.

     <p><b>Comment on the available data and its limitations.</b></p>
    <p>Deaths registered in Ireland are recorded on a quarterly basis by the CSO. There is a variable time lag between when a person dies and when that death is registered. In addition, population counts are on a yearly basis. Census, carried out in 2011, 2016, and 2022 give actual numbers while estimates, based on demographic factors, are given for the other years.</p>

    <p>There is a mismatch between population and mortality for the lowest age group. Population data records counts for years 0 to 4 while there are separate age groups for under 1 year and for 1 to 4 years in the mortality data. These two groups are combined for compatibility between population and mortality.</p>
    <p>Number of persons vaccinated comes from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Age groups in this data are not compatible with the population / mortality data from the CSO.  The CSO age group and comparible ECDPC group are given below: </p>

    <p> The analysis uses data from the COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker.  This covers all weeks from w53 2020 up to w39 2023.  It records the median cumulative uptake (%) of the primary course by age group.  The main "Data on COVID-19 vaccination in the EU/EEA" data-set only covers doses administered during the most recent weeks. </p>
    <p> This report records the "FirstDose" variable which is the "Number of first dose vaccine administered to individuals 
during the reporting week" (Data Dictionary for the COVID-19 vaccination data).  Once an person receives a single dose, mRMA particles circulate throughout the body</p>.
